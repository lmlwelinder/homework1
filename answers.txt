What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge incorporates changes made in another branch into the current branch. The changes from the other branch will be added
at the end of the current branch,

A rebase will change the version on which the current branch is based on. It will take the changes in the current branch and
reapply them on top of the head of the base branch.

2) What is a remote repository?

It is a location from which contributors can download, submit edits, and cooperate on code with each other.
